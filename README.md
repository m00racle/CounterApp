**THIS IS A COUNTER APP PROJECT FOR TREEHOUSE ANDROID COURSE EXERCISE**

Before we started the project the setting need to be modified:
 1. for the JVM was set to Java HOME
 2. for the /.../CounterApp/app/build.gradle the implementation od the appcompat-v7 need to be modified into:
 implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0-alpha1'
 
 all of those prior modiication is needed to ensure the design view can render correctly!
 
 Now this app is simple it just need to increment one number each time user click the button.
